# basic-flame-detection
Detect flames in image frames using colorspace thresholding

**using_colorspaces.py only uses thresholding on different colorspaces and not edge detection or other techniques

*Image Frame should be given as the first argument after script names

[Does give false positives]
Tweaking the threshold values or adding more ranges and bitwise logic to enable more accurate detection in varying types of images is encouraged
